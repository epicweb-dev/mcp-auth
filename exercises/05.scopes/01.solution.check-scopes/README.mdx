# Check Scopes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicai.pro/workshops/day-7-8-mcp-auth/check-scopes-xkjqu/solution" />

👨‍💼 Excellent work! We've successfully implemented scope validation utilities that give our EpicMe journaling app fine-grained control over what authenticated users can access. Now our MCP server can check if users have the required permissions before allowing them to perform sensitive operations like reading private entries or managing tags.

This improvement means users get proper access control based on their granted scopes, ensuring that personal journal data stays secure and only authorized actions are permitted. The scope validation utilities we built will be the foundation for all our permission checks going forward.

🧝‍♀️ I'm expanding this scope validation system to cover more scenarios and adding better error handling for insufficient permissions. Feel free to try implementing that yourself, or just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink> if you'd like to see how it's done.
