# Scope Hints

👨‍💼 Excellent work! We've successfully implemented scope hints that guide clients through the OAuth authorization process. Now when users encounter permission issues, their client apps can automatically discover what scopes are available and request the right permissions.

This improvement means users get clear guidance on what permissions they need, eliminating confusion and failed authentication attempts. The scope hints in both the 401 Unauthorized response and the OAuth protected resource metadata ensure clients always know exactly what to request from the authorization server.

Great work on this one.
