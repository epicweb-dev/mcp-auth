# Auth Params

👨‍💼 In EpicMe, when a user tries to access a protected journal entry, it's not enough to simply block them. We need to let them know what to do about it. If a request is missing the right credentials, the server should respond with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that includes extra details, called auth params, so the client understands what went wrong and how to fix it.

For example, if a robot tries to fetch `/api/lemonade` without the right credentials, the response should include a realm and a resource_metadata parameter:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="EpicMe", resource_metadata="https://lemonade-stand.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"
```

- **realm**: Identifies the protected area (like a journal or a lemonade stand) so clients know which resource needs credentials.
- **resource_metadata**: A URL pointing to metadata about the protected resource, helping clients discover more about what they're trying to access.

This helps clients know not just that they're blocked, but also where to look for more information about the protected resource.

For more details, see the [MDN documentation on WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate).

Let's make sure our API gives helpful feedback when things go wrong!
