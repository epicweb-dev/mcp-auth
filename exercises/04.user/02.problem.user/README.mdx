👨‍💼 Now that we have the client authenticated with the token, let's make a utility to get the user and also provide tools and resources to retrieve the user data.

🧝‍♀️ I created a resource and a tool for you, all you need to do is implement the `requireUser` utility then use that in the tool and resource. Feel free to <PrevDiffLink>check out my changes</PrevDiffLink> if you want.

👨‍💼 Great! Ok, so the goal is to make user data accessible throughout our MCP server while maintaining security and providing a seamless, personalized experience for every journaling session.
