Congratulations! You've successfully implemented user-specific functionality in your MCP server. You've moved from a generic MCP server into a personalized, secure system that knows who each user is and ensures they only access their own data.

You also now understand how to pass authentication information through Cloudflare's context system using `ctx.props`, and then using that information to create user-specific database clients and utility functions to access it in the tools, resources, and prompts.

Let's keep moving to continue building on this foundation with scope-based permissions.
