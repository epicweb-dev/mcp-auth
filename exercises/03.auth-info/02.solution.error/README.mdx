👨‍💼 Excellent! We've enhanced our error handling to provide clear, actionable feedback when clients provide invalid tokens. Now users get specific guidance about token expiration instead of generic error messages, making the authentication experience much more user-friendly.

This improvement means clients can distinguish between "no token provided" and "invalid token provided," enabling them to show appropriate messages like "Please log in again" when tokens expire.
