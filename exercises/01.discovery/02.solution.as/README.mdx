👨‍💼 Fantastic progress! Now, clients can seamlessly discover how to authenticate with our system by accessing the standardized `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint. This means any MCP-compliant client can automatically find out where to register, authorize, and obtain tokens—removing guesswork and enabling smooth, standards-based integration.

By relaying the OAuth server's metadata, we've made our MCP server a true authentication discovery hub. This empowers users to connect their tools and applications with confidence, knowing they have all the information needed for secure authentication.
