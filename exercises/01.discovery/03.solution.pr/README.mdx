# Protected Resource

üë®‚Äçüíº Outstanding achievement! Now, any client can discover how to interact with our journaling resource server in a standards-compliant way. By exposing the public `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` metadata endpoint, we've made it possible for clients to programmatically learn how to authenticate and which authorization servers to use‚Äîwithout any guesswork or manual configuration.

This means that as our system grows, each protected resource (like user profiles, journal entries, or analytics) can have its own discoverable endpoint, making integration seamless for all clients. Users benefit from a smoother onboarding experience, and developers can confidently build on top of our platform knowing that discovery is simple and future-proof.

But we're just focused on MCP. Let's keep going!
