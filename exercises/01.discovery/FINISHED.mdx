# Metadata Discovery

Congratulations! You've completed the first step in making your MCP server discoverable and accessible to any standards-compliant client.

In this exercise, you:

- Implemented CORS support for your MCP server, ensuring that clients from any domain (including web apps and desktop tools like VS Code) can connect without running into CORS policy errors.
- Used the provided `withCors` utility to handle the complexity of CORS headers, preflight requests, and response modification, so your business logic stays clean and focused.
- Configured your server to expose the correct CORS headers for the `/.well-known` endpoints, which are essential for service discovery and integration.

	By supporting CORS and the discovery endpoints, you've made it possible to use
	OAuth to authorize your MCP server to access user data securely and
	seamlessly.

Let's keep building on this foundation to make your MCP server even more powerful and user-friendly!
