# CORS

👨‍💼 Excellent work! We've successfully solved a critical problem for our MCP server users: now they can connect to our server from any domain without encountering frustrating CORS policy errors.

This improvement means users get seamless access to our MCP server's capabilities regardless of where they're connecting from. Whether they're using VS Code, a web application, or any other MCP client, the connection just works. This is exactly what users expect from a modern, accessible MCP server.
